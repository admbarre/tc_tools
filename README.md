# tc_tools
Scripts and tools for working with T-cell flow assays

# RidgePlot.ipynb
* Visualization tool to stack histograms together. Currently being used for comparing expression between cell lines through flow cytometry

# Visualize.ipynb
* Visualization of shear flow assay. Currently being used with results for a lab meeting, need to generalize tool.

# Parse Results.ipynb
  * Parses all result files and concatenates into global results file

# Tools.ipynb
  * Tools to aid in prep of experiments/assays. Meant to be run on Pythonista on my phone

# Old Notebooks/To be sorted
* Morphology Assay.ipynb
  * Reads in shape descriptor files from tracing cell outlines of Jurkats. Backburner but might revive
* Flow Assay.ipynb
  * Very old analyses from start of project 
  * TODO: scavenge for useful methods and trash
* Transmigration.ipynb
  * SUUUUPER old analyses, everything is done through FIJI scripts for now
  * TODO: scavenge for useful methods and trash
